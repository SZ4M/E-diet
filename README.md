## **E-Diet is an android application that manages human diets**

A flutter application that manages human diets, since the problems that people are suffering from are, like they donâ€™t know what a diet fits with them and what the nutrient value needed, so we made this system to solve it.
During Registration users have to fill personal information including age, weight, height, gender,routine, preferred diet, then the system calculates the nutrient value needed to satisfy the usersâ€™ needs and the system displays these values to the user and appropriate recipes according to that.
a user will be able to track his progress of his daily consumption and write his progress in his integrated diary, one of the positives the cost of time and money is less from going to a diet consultant.
